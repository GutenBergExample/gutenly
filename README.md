# Gutenly - A collection of must have Gutenberg blocks by Rhys Clay

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

## Current blocks

* Image & Text : a simple, side by side image and text block
* Feature list (in development): a list of features with nice thumbnails

Getting started:

## ðŸ‘‰ `npm start`

* Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
* Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰ `npm run build`

* Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
* Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

## ðŸ‘‰ `npm run eject`

* Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
* Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
* It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
* You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
